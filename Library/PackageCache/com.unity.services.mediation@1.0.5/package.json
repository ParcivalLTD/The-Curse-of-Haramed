Learn how to integrate the LevelPlay plug-in at https://developers.is.com/developer-docs/unity/ \n\nThe Advertisement with Mediation package contains Unityâ€™s own ad mediation solution, which is no longer being enhanced. You may still download and use until further notice, but we recommend using Unity LevelPlay for longer term support and improvements.\n\nSupported platforms:\n- Android\n- iOS",
